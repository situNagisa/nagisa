# nagisa C++ Libraries

The nagisa project provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. nagisa libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The nagisa license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use and does not require attribution for binary use.
